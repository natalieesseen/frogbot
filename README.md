# frogbot 2023 üê∏ü§ñ

My thesis project at Changemaker Educations was to create a Discord-bot for my community "Froggies & Friends". The bot is built with [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/), which is a node.js module that allows you to interact with the Discord API. To interact with the SQLite-database, the bot is using [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/), which is a node.js ORM.


‚ö†Ô∏è I see this repo getting forked and starred every now and then, and while I believe it can be helpful to get some insights on how a Discord-bot with an economy-system is built, **I do not** recommend you use this repo to build your own Discord-bot. Most importantly, I am not maintaining this bot since it's not being used anymore, and there are *many* security issues (most could probably be fixed with updating depencencies but alas). Secondly, I have learned a lot since I graduated, and I cringe when I look back at this code; but I still want to keep the repo public in case someone can learn a thing or two.
